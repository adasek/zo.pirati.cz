However, it has also revealed a number of existing sore points, such as the fragile position of people working in precarious forms of employment or fierce gender segregation in many professions. Both the pandemic itself and the consequences of some of the measures have had a negative impact on women. In particular home-schooling in connection with work from home has tested the perception of work-life balance in the Czech Republic. The test may reveal that the social value of women's gainful activity is still much lower than the perception of their domestic and family responsibilities.
